# Smart-Contact-Manager
This is a learning project, with the main goal being to develop an application that manages contacts more intelligently and fully authenticates and authorises them, all while storing contacts in an extremely efficient manner. Spring Boot Thymeleaf was utilised in the creation of this project, while Spring Security was used for authorization and authentication.

Database CRUD activities are carried out via Spring Data JPA, while back-end development is done with Spring Boot.
The front end is developed using Thymeleaf as the template engine, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap.
MySQL is the database language.
